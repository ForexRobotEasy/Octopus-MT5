## How it Works ##

1. Include necessary libraries and classes:

```mql5
#include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
#include <Trade\PositionInfo.mqh>
```

2. Define constants:

```mql5
#define MAGIC_NUMBER 12345   // Magic number for trade identification
```

3. Implement the `OnStart` function:

```mql5
void OnStart()
{
   // Define currency pairs to trade
   string[] currencyPairs = {'EURUSD', 'GBPUSD', 'USDJPY', 'AUDUSD'};

   // Loop through each currency pair
   for(int i=0; i<ArraySize(currencyPairs); i++)
   {
      // Initialize the trade class
      CTrade trade;

      // Set the magic number for the current currency pair
      trade.SetExpertMagicNumber(MAGIC_NUMBER);

      // Perform trade operations
      if(trade.Buy(currencyPairs[i], 0.1, 'Buy order', 0, 0, 0))
      {
         // Buy order executed successfully
         Print('Buy order executed for ', currencyPairs[i]);
      }
      else
      {
         // Buy order failed
         Print('Buy order failed for ', currencyPairs[i]);
      }

      // Sleep for 5 seconds before executing the next trade
      Sleep(5000);
   }
}
```

4. In the `OnStart` function, the code defines an array of currency pairs to trade. It then loops through each currency pair and performs the following steps:
   - Initializes the `CTrade` class.
   - Sets the magic number for trade identification using `trade.SetExpertMagicNumber`.
   - Executes a buy order for the current currency pair using `trade.Buy`.
   - Prints the execution status of the buy order.
   - Sleeps for 5 seconds before executing the next trade.
